Welcome to Stuff of Things. This is where I will be putting all the stuff I make, games mostly. Check back for new stuff. Maybe I'll make a newsletter or something in the future.

<h2> Sole Defender</h2>
<br>
Here it is, my first game.
<br>
NOTE: I just created an itch.io page for this game. It will contain all the latest updates and info from now on. Version 1.2 is there.
