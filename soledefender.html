<br>

Upgrade your ship, plan your tactics, and defend the solar system from the alien menace who wants to harvest our solar system for resources.

<h2> Notes and other Info</h2>
<br>
Current version:  1.1
<br>
This game is still in its testing phase. As a result, weird things may occur. Please report any bugs you find. Also, the game is definitely in need of balancing. Its supposed to be hard as its somewhat of a Rogue-like. I'm also planning on releasing updates to make the game better as time goes on. I'm also planning on releasing DLC-like stuff periodically.
<br>
The game only works on Windows, sorry Mac users :(.

<h2>More About the Game</h2>
<br>
The positions of all the planets are randomly generated along their orbital path around the sun every time a new game is started. This means that no two playthroughs will be alike. Some planets may start very close to two alien motherships while others may spawn far from alien motherships. You need to defend four space stations from four alien motherships that are constantly gathering resources to produce new ships to attack these space stations. If all the space stations are destroyed, you lose. Your goal is to destroy all alien ships thus saving the solar system. 
<br>

<h2>Your Ship</h2>
<br>
<br>
All your ship's information is displayed at the bottom of the screen. HP (hull points) represents the health of your ship's hull. When it reaches zero, your ship explodes. SP (shield points) is displayed below the HP bar and represents the health of your ship's shields. Taking damage while your shields are active reduces your SP. When your SP reaches zero, your shields deactivate and your ship will start taking hull damage. After a recharge period, your shields will come back online. WP (weapon energy) is the pool of available energy your ship has for primary weapons. Each primary weapon costs a certain number of WP to fire. If you don't have enough WP to fire your primary weapon, wait for your weapon energy to recharge or use a battery on your weapon system. EP (engine points) are the capacity of engine energy you have available. EP is used when travelling faster than light (FTL). Your ship also has a variety of secondary weapons. Secondary weapons do not consume WP when used, instead, they consume conventional ammunition purchased from space stations. 

<br>
<h2>Escape Pods</h2>
<br>
Escape pods represent how many "lives" you have. When your ship is destroyed, if you have at least one escape pod left, you will respawn at the nearest space station with a stock ship. True to its Rogue-like nature, you lose all upgrades and items when you explode. So try not to explode. 
<br>
<h2> Credits</h2>
<br>
Credits are earned through destroying alien ships. The better you do in space combat, the more destroyed alien ships will drop credits rather than other pick-ups such as batteries and health pick-ups. Credits are spent at space stations to upgrade your ship, make repairs, and replenish your secondary weapon ammo.
<br>
<h2> Batteries</h2>
<br>
Batteries are used to recharge your ship's sub-systems. Press the corresponding key to use a battery on that ship system. You can only carry a limited amount of batteries at a time so use them wisely.
<br>
<h2>LIDAR</h2>
<br>
To the right of your sub-system display is your LIDAR display. This shows you, in real-time, the position of all planets and alien ship movements. Your ship is represented as a small white triangle while all alien ships are red dots. You will be alerted by your ship's on-board computer when a space station is under attack and the space station in question's location will flash on the LIDAR. The HP and SP of all four space stations are constantly being fed to your ship's computer allowing you to monitor the stations' status in real-time. 
<br>
<h2> Tips and Hints</h2>
<br>
</center>
Strategize- there are more than one way to save the solar system. Offense may be the best defense.
<br>
Get creative- disrupting alien supply lines by attacking the collector ships is a sure-fire way to starve alien motherships for resources.
<br>
Observe- Keep an eye on alien ship movements. Once an alien assault fleet starts to mass near an alien mothership, the fleet will travel at FTL speeds to attack the nearest space station.
<br>
Analyze- prioritize space stations that are very close to more than one alien mothership. These will get hit twice as much than stations that don't have any motherships near them.
<br>
Upgrades- want to be fast and avoid damage? Go for thruster upgrades. Want to be a tank that can stand up to a lot of punishment? Go for HP/SP upgrades. Want to be able to spot enemies from further away? Upgrade your sensors. Customize your ship to your strategy.
<br>
It's lonely out here in space.

<h2>Planned Future Updates</h2>
<br>
</center>
Game saves upon completion of game saving all your stats for that playthrough. For now, just screenshot your final score.
<br>
More in-depth scoring- loss of points for destroyed space stations, more points for destroying alien motherships, gold? silver? bronze?
<br>
More alien ship types- definitely going to do a cloaked ship type.
<br>
Definitely more weapon types and upgrades.
